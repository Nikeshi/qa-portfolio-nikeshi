# 👩‍💻 QA Tester Portfolio – Nikeshi Kiriwaththuduwa

Hi! I’m **Nikeshi**, a QA Tester with **2+ years of hands-on experience** in manual testing across web and system-based applications.

I specialize in **finding issues before users do**, edge-case testing, and collaborating closely with developers and product teams to deliver high-quality software. I’m currently growing my skills toward **automation testing and product operations**.
